# Exploratory Data-Analysis using Python on Hotel-Bookings-Demand

## Project Title - Hotel Booking demands
The hotel booking demand dataset contains information on hotel bookings from two hotels, one located in a resort city and the other in a city center. The dataset includes 119,390 observations and 32 features including booking information such as arrival and departure dates, room type, and booking source, as well as guest demographic information such as country of origin and travel purpose. Additionally, the dataset includes whether the booking was cancelled or not.

## Dataset source:
Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand

## Goal of the project:
The purpose of this dataset is to gain insights into hotel booking trends and patterns.


## Tasks are implemented in the Project:

- Data Preparation and Cleaning
- Exploratory Analysis and Visualization
- Asking and Answering Questions
- Inferences and Conclusion

## Tools and Techniques Used:
- Numpy (used for operations on numeric data)
- Pandas (used for utilising DataFrames and organising the data)
- Matplotlib (for visualization of data)
- Seaborn (used alongside Matplotlib for visualization)
- Jovian (used for downloading dataset and to run, save and upload the Notebook)

## Insights from the Dataset:

#### Peak booking season:
The analysis showed that hotel bookings were higher during the summer months (July and August) for both hotels, while bookings were lower during the winter months (January and February). This suggests that seasonality plays an important role in hotel bookings.

#### Lead time and Cancellation Rate:
The dataset shows that nearly 40% of bookings were cancelled. The analysis showed that most bookings were made between 0 and 100 days prior to arrival. Furthermore, the probability of cancellation increased with the lead time. This suggests that hotels should develop effective strategies to manage bookings made closer to the check-in date to avoid cancellations.

#### Booking Source:
It is interesting to note that almost 40% of bookings were made through travel agencies or tour operators, followed by direct hotel bookings (30%). This could suggest that hotels should invest more in collaborating with travel agencies to reach a wider audience and increase bookings.

#### Preferred Room Type:
The dataset shows that the most commonly booked room type is the standard double room. This information could be useful for hotel managers to ensure that they have enough inventory of the most popular room type and to adjust prices accordingly.

#### Market Segmentation:
The analysis showed that most bookings were made by individuals and couples, followed by families. Furthermore, the majority of bookings were made by people from Portugal, followed by the UK, France, Spain, and Germany. This suggests that hotels should develop effective strategies to cater to different market segments and their specific needs.

#### Length of Stay:
The dataset shows that the majority of bookings are for 1 or 2 nights. By offering promotions for longer stays, hotels could encourage customers to book longer stays and increase revenue.


These insights can be used by the hotels to optimize their pricing and marketing strategies, better plan for staff and inventory needs, and improve customer satisfaction by catering to their needs and preferences.
